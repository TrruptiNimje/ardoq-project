* ** Magento Web and API test automation Project** *
  Test automation project for https://magento.softwaretestingboard.com/ website.
  
1. test_all_test_case.py:-  is the main test where it covers all end to end functionality check in one go plus API verification.
2. Other test files are just divided in a way to run each function at a time.
3. reports directory:- This holds the reports generated for the test run, this report can be opened in any web browser.


** Note: Registering a user first is mandatory as per the test flow I have writen. 
To make the happy flow work seamless just change the Email ID in conftest.py every time before running the test **
